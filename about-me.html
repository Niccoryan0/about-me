I graduated from Monroe High School in 2014 and started at University of Oregon in Eugene the next fall. During this time, I worked at a dining venue on campus both as a regular student worker in my first year then as a student shift leader the following two. 4 years later, I graduated with a degree in Geology, minoring in Geography and worked over my graduating summer as a research assistant. After that I moved back to Washington and I worked as a cook for almost a year until quitting and running off to Europe for 5 months before coming back and starting up here at Code Fellows.</p>

      <p id='goalsP'> I like to think that my goals are relatively simple. I aspire to live a fulfilling and happy enough life that I feel content at the end of it. I'd like to do work I feel matters to myself and to others, and that challenges and rewards me. My main goal in life though is just to grow and improve as a person however I'm able.</p>
