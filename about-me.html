        <p class='sectionB' id='bioB'>Hi, my name is Nicco Ryan, I am a 24 year old male from Monroe, Washington. I graduated from Monroe High School in 2014 and started at University of Oregon in Eugene the next fall. During this time, I worked at a dining venue on campus both as a student worker for a year then as a student shift leader the following two. In 2018 I graduated with a degree in Geology and worked briefly as a research assistant. After that I moved back to Washington and I worked as a cook for almost a year until quitting and running off to Europe for 5 months before coming back and starting up here at Code Fellows.</p>

        <h2 class='sectionH'  id='goalsH'>Goals</h2>
        <p class='sectionB' id='goalsB'> I like to think that my goals are relatively simple. I aspire to live a fulfilling and happy enough life that I feel content at the end of it. I'd like to do work I feel matters to myself and to others, and that challenges and rewards me. My main goal in life though is just to grow and improve as a person however I'm able.</p>
